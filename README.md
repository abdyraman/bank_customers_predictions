# bank_customers_predictions
The goal of this code is to analyze a dataset on customer churn in a banking context and develop predictive models for forecasting customer attrition. It begins by preparing and exploring the dataset, addressing missing values, dropping unnecessary customer-specific columns, and conducting initial data exploration. Subsequently, the code performs exploratory data analysis to visualize proportions of churned and retained customers, as well as analyze the relationships between various features and customer churn. After transforming categorical data into a suitable format, it proceeds to model using a random forest regressor and a neural network with hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. Ultimately, the code aims to provide insights and predictions about customer churn by utilizing data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and advanced machine learning techniques.
